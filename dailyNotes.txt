assn1: gather reqs.
do: set the port
so call prog portsetter all lower
phases:-
	1: print msg saying listening on port x what user specifies as cmd line arg -p for setting port num --port <number>
		no default port. no params gives usage screen. 
		error print error message, print usage, return non-zero and comment in code why. 2^16=65k ports
		success returns 0 also if no params do this. this is not an error.
		req: another way to get help -h or --help is success, prints out usage screen
		google doc for req doc. get link and paste link
		for code , just turn in .cpp
		req doc: english words
			program mut print out usage screen and return 0 on no params
			in a comment on the page give a link to the google doc as turn in.
			will do above if -h or --help
			
			sad path and happy path testing and on req docs. show both on req docs.
			code happy path first, then sad.
			sad: "first arg must start with  a dash"
				"usage..."
				return non-0
				"invalid flag"
				usage
				return
		make a usage() method. returns nothing. just print.
			make usage its own file so can be passed off to someone else.
		"put it on the stack, so you can stay on track"

how to get cin from within a bash script:
	file redirection: $ ./prog1 >output.txt < input.txt
		$ ./prog1 > file1 && prog2 < file1
		same as: prog1 tmp.txt | prog2
	pipe and redirect not thesame. pipe takes program, redir takes files.
